					Hypermedia is pretty cool. This is very much a hack to make it
					work. It's kind of working though. I need to make some kind of
					`&lt;pre is="markdown-view"&gt;` for rendering markdown. I also
					need to do `pre is=` for doing this field as well.

					```js
					function oh_wow() {
						console.log("That would be nice");
					}
					```

					### Next steps

					Then I think it would be nice to start discovering re-usable
					view stuff. It is kind of annoying to have to do all the work
					to make things look nice every time.

					I'm vaguely curious if I can even do signals or something,
					but I don't want to get ahead of myself. Maybe a spreadsheet
					component or something like that.

					Another cool idea would be nested `&lt;entity-data&gt;`
					components, because then I could have ideas inside of posts
					or something like that. Heterogenous collections that are
					not all of the same type would be pretty cool too.
