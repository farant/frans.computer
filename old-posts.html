              Hypermedia is pretty cool. This is very much a hack to make it
              work. It's kind of working though. I need to make some kind of
              `&lt;pre is="markdown-view"&gt;` for rendering markdown. I also
              need to do `pre is=` for doing this field as well.

              ```js
              function oh_wow() {
                  console.log("That would be nice");
              }
              ```

              ### Next steps

              Then I think it would be nice to start discovering re-usable
              view stuff. It is kind of annoying to have to do all the work
              to make things look nice every time.

              I'm vaguely curious if I can even do signals or something,
              but I don't want to get ahead of myself. Maybe a spreadsheet
              component or something like that.

              Another cool idea would be nested `&lt;entity-data&gt;`
              components, because then I could have ideas inside of posts
              or something like that. Heterogenous collections that are
              not all of the same type would be pretty cool too.
